# Blockchain Developer Support Chatbot

## Introduction

This report outlines the work procedures and details the academic project conducted by four students: Digiesi Enrico, Garofalo Ciminiello Carlo Alberto, Loconsole Christian, and Losole Luca. The primary objective of this project was to create a supporting tool for Blockchain developers. The tool is designed to analyze a set of characteristics and their importance and provide recommendations for the most suitable Blockchain solution based on these criteria.

## Project Description

The project aimed to develop a chatbot as the primary interface for assisting developers in selecting the appropriate Blockchain technology. A chatbot is a software application that enables online text-based or text-to-speech conversations, offering a direct and interactive experience with users. The goal was to create a chatbot that convincingly simulates human conversation and behavior, thereby providing users with a personalized and helpful decision-making tool.

The chatbot developed by the team responds to various messages and queries submitted by users. In addition, to enhance user interaction and accessibility, it is equipped with a graphical user interface (GUI), making it easy to engage with the tool beyond the confines of a terminal.

It is worth noting that this project involved collaboration with another group. Part of the project's success hinged on providing the chatbot with accurate and up-to-date information about different Blockchain technologies. To achieve this, the collaborating group undertook the task of researching and analyzing various types of Blockchains to ensure that the chatbot could make informed recommendations.

## Project Objectives

The key objectives of the project are as follows:

1. Develop a chatbot that can interact with users and understand their criteria for choosing a Blockchain.
2. Provide the chatbot with a comprehensive database of Blockchain technologies.
3. Implement an algorithm that can analyze user input and recommend the most suitable Blockchain based on the provided criteria.
4. Create an intuitive and user-friendly GUI to enhance the chatbot's accessibility.
5. Ensure that the chatbot's recommendations are based on accurate and up-to-date information about different Blockchains.
